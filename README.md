## üìå Project Description

This project investigates how macroeconomic factors influence the stock prices of Canadian energy companies, particularly in Alberta‚Äîa region heavily dependent on oil and energy. The study combines stock data with various macroeconomic indicators to discover correlations and draw insights useful for financial analysts, policymakers, and investors.

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand the correlation between stock price movements and macroeconomic indicators.
- Identify the macroeconomic factors with the strongest influence on stock volatility.
- Examine how different companies in the energy sector react to changes in macroeconomic conditions.
